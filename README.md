# Netflix Recommendation Optimization with Active Learning

This repository explores a data-driven approach to optimize Netflix's recommendation system, particularly for a small data science team.

**Problem:** 
A small team struggles to keep up with the massive volume of user data to provide effective recommendations.

**Solution:** 
Active learning focuses on collecting high-impact user feedback for uncertain recommendations. 

**Implementation:** 
A Scrum-based approach is used to:
1. Train an initial model.
2. Design feedback mechanisms.
3. Continuously improve the model.
4. Evaluate model performance.
5. Reflect on the process.

**Benefits:**
* Improved data quality 
* Adaptability to user behavior 
* Enhanced user engagement

**Challenges and Mitigation:**
* **Active Learning:** Design effective queries, avoid overfitting.
* **Project Management:** Manage limited resources, ensure privacy, explore diverse feedback mechanisms.

By addressing these challenges and leveraging active learning, Netflix can deliver more accurate and personalized recommendations, fostering user satisfaction and retention.
